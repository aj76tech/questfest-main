I have created a Quiz website consisting of three pages, the Landing page(index.html) this is where a user enters their phone number and presses the play button which takes them to the quiz page, the quiz page(quiz.html) this is where the user is given 5 multiple choice question one after the other and for each correct answer the user wins a coupon and then taken to the completion page(completion_page.html) where the number of coupons won will be displayed. this is all coded using the visual studio code and run through the live server at port 5501, and works perfectly fine and appears as expected. so now when the user enters the phone number at the landing page, it needs to be stored in a database( but under the condition that, the number is sent to the database only if the user completes the quiz) , the number entered is also used to check whether the user has already played the quiz, if they did they will not be allowed to play the quiz again. also later at the end of the quiz, the number of coupons won is calculated and stored alongside the phone number, and retrieved to send a whatsapp message to the number using the whatsapp api. The choice of DB is MONGODB I have already installed the MongoDB Compass, and created a cluster - 'SoulocalMarketing' and the user username will be 'Marketing', the database created is 'gameDatabase' and collection namely 'phoneNumber'.
